House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data

This repository will demonstrate multiple methods with in depth detail and interepretation. 

I have decided to update my prediction reuslts and work on it further 
I introduced a better feature engineering and multiple predction methods.

Feature Engineering: 

1. Advanced Outlier Removal 
2. Multiple Variable Transformation: Logarithm, Box Cox
3. Fixing of Skewness

Prediction Methods
1. XGBoost, Elastic Net, LightGBM, LASSO, Kernel Ridge, Gradient Boosting
2. Stacking with mlxtend, using a XGBoost Classification
3. Tune parameters with GridSearchCV



Through this My results improved and achieved top 9% on the leader board. 

Notebook would be updated shortly since I still have some editing to do. 


Old methods used: 
1. PCA (Dimension reduction) and PCA Regression
2. Regression methods (MLR) and variable selection with Elastic Net/LASSO/Ridge regression
