https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data

This repository will demonstrate multiple methods with in depth detail and interepretation. 

I have decided to update my prediction reuslts and work on it further 
I introduced a better feature engineering and multiple predction methods.
1. XGBoost, Elastic Net, LightGBM, LASSO, Kernel Ridge, Gradient Boosting
2. Advanced Outlier Removal 
3. Multiple Variable Transformation: Logarithm, Box Cox
4. Fixing of Skewness

Through this My results improved and achieved top 9% on the leader board. 

Notebook would be updated shortly since I still have some editing to do. 


Old methods used: 
1. PCA (Dimension reduction) and PCA Regression
2. Regression methods (MLR) and variable selection with Elastic Net/LASSO/Ridge regression
